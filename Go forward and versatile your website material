Before you begin circulating the material you may want to consider creating some simple changes to 

the material so it is not just like the material on your website. You should also consider getting 

your lately engaged material licensed with Innovative Commons to be able to protect yourself from 

duplicate material problems.

The most important places to distribute your website material is on group press sites like Facebook 

or myspace, public save management sites like Stumble Upon and material submission sites like 

Publication Content.

Consider Mixture Works

Using mixture features can eliminate any problems of having material just like material that will 

appear on other sites. If you distribute mixture versions of your material you eliminate any 

duplicate material problems.

Derivative features are similar but not just like the original material designed for your website. 

You can change the starting passing, finishing passing and some conditions in each phrase and 

distribute it without any concern about duplicate material.

Go forward and versatile your website material. If you do it properly you can make sure you are 

getting maximum possible value out of your website sources.
