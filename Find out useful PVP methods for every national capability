I think PvP is not so exciting, the reasons are as follows:
First of all, the experience website.  Adventures start each other's carcass to money, down 

directly  the hosting server. This, it is destined that the WOW activity website simply will not be 

able to back up large-scale actions of the PVP group.
Secondly, the material of PvP is lacking. Arena can barely be mentioned as PvP material, and also, 

Huge Azeroth, Delano, stage  from to stage , from  gamers to  gamers, how about the raid content? 

How many PvP? Are there some locations for PvPer to bring themselves into complete play?
