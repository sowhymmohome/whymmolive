The devices specifications are very nice. They are there more to create sure that somebody who has 

no idea what they are doing (say somebody's first personality who doesn't even know the dungeon 

names) doesn't get into one of better circumstances until they have a little more than pursuit 

doldrums.

If you're innovative enough to be posting on these community forums, then you're innovative enough 

to know what tanking an Icecrown dungeon needs and whether you're up to the task.
We do want to and try to use all available statistics for devices. If every Essential item was 

hurry and crit, then every item would look the same and get very tedious.
We experience it is okay for certain statistics to be more useful than others, but on the category 

part factors have gotten too lopsided, usually because of over-generous capabilities that turn 

statistics or give e.g. too much hurry. No stat should ever be value twice the value of another. 

We are aware of these problems and this is a big factor of the talent shrub redo we have planned 

for Cataclysm.

Generally speaking, fight scores are too great right now. This is partly because of the above but 

also because product stages ended up being greater than we initially designed to be able to 

embrace the heroic model we began using in Ulduar and in all the raid dungeon since then. Gamers 

should not ideally be worried about reaching the hurry and crit caps ever, and certainly not at 

the very beginning of Icecrown Citadel. In come back, the scores in Cataclysm should be much more 

complicated to cap. <a href="http://www.vipdiablo3gold.com/CD-Key/">Diablo iii cd key</a><br><br>
